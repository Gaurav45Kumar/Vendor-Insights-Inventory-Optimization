   - Highlighted high-margin yet low-selling items for targeted pricing or promotional strategies.

3. **Statistical Testing**  
   - Conducted hypothesis testing to assess profitability differences between vendor tiers.

4. **Risk Assessment**  
   - Evaluated vendor dependency to flag supply chain concentration risk.
